QuEmb is a robust framework designed to implement the Bootstrap Embedding (BE) method,
efficiently treating electron correlation in molecules, surfaces, and solids. This repository contains
the Python implementation of the BE methods, including periodic bootstrap embedding.
The code leverages `PySCF <https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf>`_ library for quantum chemistry calculations and utlizes Python's
multiprocessing module to enable parallel computations in high-performance computing environments.

QuEmb includes two libraries: ``molbe`` and ``kbe``.
The ``molbe`` library implements BE for molecules and supramolecular complexes,
while the ``kbe`` library is designed to handle periodic systems such as surfaces and solids using periodic BE.
